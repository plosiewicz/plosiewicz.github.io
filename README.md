## Projects
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| :notebook: [Comparitive Report on Supervised ML Models](supervised_comparison.pdf) | Python (scikit-learn, pandas)| Extending the methodology performed by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil in 2006 at UC Irvine, this report compares Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on three large datasets. A grid search was employed to identify the optimal hyperparameters for each classifier. Ultimately, this report provides an analysis of which contexts are best suited for each binary classifier and examines the impact of feature set size and quality. |
| üê∂ [Dog Adoption](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Dog%20Adoption) | Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
