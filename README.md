## Projects
| Project Link | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| :pizza: [Food.com EDA and Predictive Modeling](https://plosiewicz.github.io/exploratory-analysis-recipes/) | Python (scikit-learn, pandas, Plotly), HTML/CSS, Jupyter Notebook | Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of a real-world Food.com recipes and reviews dataset. It demonstrates expertise in data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, natural language processing, missing data analysis, and predictive modeling.|
| :movie_camera: [IMDb D3 Bubble Chart](https://plosiewicz.github.io/dsc106-project3/) | Javacript (D3), HTML/CSS, Python (pandas)| This project highlights my proficiency in data visualization, with a focus on data preparation, encoding strategies, animation techniques, and interactive elements. Built using D3.js, the visualization required meticulous animation tuning to ensure smooth transitions and a seamless user experience|
| :notebook: [Comparitive Report on Supervised ML Models](supervised_comparison.pdf) | Python (scikit-learn, pandas), Jupyter Notebook| Extending the methodology performed by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil in 2006 at UC Irvine, this report compares Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on three large datasets. A grid search was employed to identify the optimal hyperparameters for each classifier. Ultimately, this report provides an analysis of which contexts are best suited for each binary classifier and examines the impact of feature set size and quality. |
